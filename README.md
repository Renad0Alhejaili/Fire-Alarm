# Fire Alarm System Using Arduino  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **fire alarm system** using an **Arduino microcontroller**. The system is designed to detect fire through sensors and trigger an alarm to alert nearby individuals, providing a simple yet effective fire safety solution.

---

## Features  
- **Fire Detection:** Monitors temperature and smoke levels using sensors.  
- **Buzzer Alarm:** Emits a loud sound when fire is detected.  
- **LED Indicator:** Lights up to visually alert individuals of danger.  
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Ensures immediate response to potential fire hazards.

## Components Used  
1. **Arduino Uno**: Acts as the main controller.  
2. **Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35)**: Detects temperature changes.  
3. **Smoke Sensor (e.g., MQ-2)**: Monitors smoke levels in the environment.  
4. **Buzzer**: Emits an audible alarm during fire detection.  
5. **LEDs**: Indicate the system's status.  
6. **Resistors and Jumper Wires**: For circuit connections.  
7. **Power Supply**: Provides power to the Arduino and components.

## Installation and Setup  
1. Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.  
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino board.  
3. Power the system using a 9V battery or USB connection.  
4. Test the system by exposing it to temperature and smoke changes.  

---

## How It Works  
1. The **temperature** and **smoke sensors** continuously monitor the environment.  
2. When fire indicators (high temperature or smoke levels) are detected:  
   - The **buzzer** is activated.  
   - The **LEDs** light up to visually signal the fire hazard.  
3. The system resets once the environment returns to safe conditions.
